What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
.git file is added so I can track files ad start the version repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working dir is just the raw dir/folder with your files.  Once you add the files are moved into the staging directory

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Always check the staging area when coding, to make sure you have not moved on and left anything else around, which should be committed.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Producation branch.   Developer Branch.    This way dev checks in code to dev branch, and CI server builds and updates the web
server.  When these changes are tested we then move on and merge to the Production Branch.

The less branching we have the better because too many branches become a hazard.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Helps on see the paths of developement and the unreachable heads

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
All code in one file, one repository.  Because both branches grew and then merged.

Merge branch 'master' into easy-mode

Conflicts:
	game.js

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Auto is good when there are no conflicts.  When you have conflicts it's best to review them
in detail.  Conflicts typically mean the code will break if the merge was done automatic
without a review.
