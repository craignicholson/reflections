What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
.git file is added so I can track files ad start the version repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working dir is just the raw dir/folder with your files.  Once you add the files are moved into the staging directory

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Always check the staging area when coding, to make sure you have not moved on and left anything else around, which should be committed.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Producation branch.   Developer Branch.    This way dev checks in code to dev branch, and CI server builds and updates the web
server.  When these changes are tested we then move on and merge to the Production Branch.

The less branching we have the better because too many branches become a hazard.
